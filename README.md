# ASL Recognition System

## Description
This project implements an ASL recognition system using computer vision and machine learning. It processes hand landmarks detected by Mediapipe and trains a model to recognize gestures.

## Create dataset - WIP
1. Set up virtual environment
pip install virtualenv

Navigate to project folder

python -m venv venv

.\venv\Scripts\activate


## Dependencies
The following libraries are required to run the project:
- `os`: Built-in Python module for file and directory management (no installation required).
- `pickle`: Built-in Python module for serializing and de-serializing objects (no installation required).
- `mediapipe`: For hand landmarks detection.
- `matplotlib`: For plotting and visualization.
- `numpy`: For numerical computations.
- `opencv-python`: For image and video processing.
- `scikit-learn`: For machine learning algorithms.

## Installation

Install the required libraries with the following command:

```bash
pip install opencv-python mediapipe matplotlib numpy scikit-learn
```
